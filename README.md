# Iris CE (Compact Edition) Case

Design files for Iris CE case parts

## Coming Soon

Printable Iris CE case parts will eventually be made available here. Right now, the current case design files are specific to aluminum CNC and plastic injection molding processes and would need modification for them to be used for 3D printing.

Files to expect once we're less busy with other things:
- Tenting accessories
    - Tripod adapter
    - Tenting legs
- Printable tray (might need threaded heat-set inserts, TBD)

## Files

Files will mainly be provided in a format closely related to the design, so for 2D designs, DXFs will be provided, and not STLs. For STLs, you will need to generate your own from the 2D design files.

- Switch Plate - Designed to be 1.2mm thick so Choc switches can clip in
- Plate Support - Goes in between PCB and Switch Plate, designed to be 1.0mm thick

These case files are released under the MIT License.
