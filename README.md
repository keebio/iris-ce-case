# Iris CE (Compact Edition) Case

Design files for Iris CE case parts

## Coming Soon

Printable Iris CE case parts will eventually be made available here. Right now, the current case design files are specific to aluminum CNC and plastic injection molding processes and would need modification for them to be used for 3D-printing.

Files to expect once we're less busy with other things:
- Plate file
- Tenting accessories
    - Tripod adapter
    - Tenting legs
- Printable tray (might need threaded heat-set inserts, TBD)
